UW Profits common before 1980
- 2 of every 3 years prior to 1980 had combined ratios below 100 

No UW profit recorded for 25 straight years from 1979 to 2003

### Calendar Year Loss Ratios by Year

```{r pic-8, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/where-is-the-profit-8.png')
```

- Average expense ratio from 1970 – 2010 approximately 28%
- Rule of thumb for the industry - loss ratios below 72% will produce UW profit

### Combined Ratio Points Associated with Catastrophe Losses

```{r pic-9, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}

- CAT Loss contribution to combined ratios by year has increased almost four fold since 1990 relative to 1960 to 1989

### Calendar Year vs. Accident Year Loss Ratios

.center[
```{r pic-10, echo=FALSE, out.width='85%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/where-is-the-profit-10.png')
```
]

- Since 1996, reserve development has contributed between -4.3 to +6.4 calendar year loss ratio points
- Currently we are in a period of favorable reserve development
    - Accident year on average 2.5 points worse than calendar year
- How long can favorable reserve development continue to suppress loss ratios?

### Historical Premium Leverage

.center[
```{r pic-11, echo=FALSE, out.width='85%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/where-is-the-profit-11.png')
```
]

- Surplus has grown at faster rate than premium since 1975
- In 1975, every combined ratio point of profit generated an ROE of 2.7%
- In 2011, a combined ratio point of profit only generates a 0.7% ROE

.center[
```{r pic-20, echo=FALSE, out.width='75%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/where-is-the-profit-20.png')
```

Loss to GDP has instead had 2 distinctive historical trends:
- Increasing trend up to 1987
- Decreasing trend since 1987

P&C insured risk as share of GDP has been shrinking

### A 100% Combined Ratio Isn’t What It Once Was…

.center[
```{r pic-21, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}

- At 3:1 asset leverage, a 200 bps drop in yield results in a 600 bps drop in ROE

.center[
```{r pic-25, echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/where-is-the-profit-25.png')

- Quarterly personal lines DWP exceeded commercial lines in Q4 2009 for the first time
- Although personal lines annual premium volume continues to be larger than commercial lines, commercial lines premiums continue to grow at a faster rate in Q3 2011
- Audit premiums suppressed commercial lines DWP in 2009, exacerbating 2009 declines and inflating 2010 increases beyond changes based on rate and exposure
