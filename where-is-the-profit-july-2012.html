### Combined Ratio Points Associated with Catastrophe Losses

&lt;img src="img/where-is-the-profit-9.png" width="100%" /&gt;

]

- Since 1996, reserve development has contributed between -4.3 to +6.4 calendar year loss ratio points
- Currently we are in a period of favorable reserve development
    - Accident year on average 2.5 points worse than calendar year
- How long can favorable reserve development continue to suppress loss ratios?
